
rhminer api support EthMan api format and structure with some limitations.
    1 - At the exception of 'miner_getstat1', the rest of the api needs a pw that match what was passed to rhminer (see -apipw with rhminer and 'Password' field in EthMan)
    2 - For security reasons, method "miner_file" ONLY accept config.txt and config.xml.
        The config file must be under 8K
        The config file must be an rhminer compatible config file containing xml data
        With parameter 'forcerestart' the miner will restart uppon reception of the config file, no mather what was the command line given to rhminer orignialy.
    3 - miner_getstat2 return same as miner_getstat1
    4 - Fan and temperature data are all zero
    
To change miner's config remotly, using EthMan, you send a config.txt first then restart the miner.

EthMan uses raw TCP/IP connections (not HTTP) for remote management and statistics. Optionally, "psw" field is added to requests is the password for remote management is set for miner.
The following commands are available (JSON format):

RESPONSE:
{"result": ["9.3 - ETH", "21", "182724;51;0", "30502;30457;30297;30481;30479;30505", "0;0;0", "off;off;off;off;off;off", "53;71;57;67;61;72;55;70;59;71;61;70", "eth-eu1.nanopool.org:9999", "0;0;0;0"]}
"9.3 - ETH"				- miner version.
"21"					- running time, in minutes.
"182724"				- total ETH hashrate in MH/s, number of ETH shares, number of ETH rejected shares.
"30502;30457;30297;30481;30479;30505"	- detailed ETH hashrate for all GPUs.
"0;0;0"					- total DCR hashrate in MH/s, number of DCR shares, number of DCR rejected shares.
"off;off;off;off;off;off"		- detailed DCR hashrate for all GPUs.
"53;71;57;67;61;72;55;70;59;71;61;70"	- Temperature and Fan speed(%) pairs for all GPUs.
"eth-eu1.nanopool.org:9999"		- current mining pool. For dual mode, there will be two pools here.
"0;0;0;0"				- number of ETH invalid shares, number of ETH pool switches, number of DCR invalid shares, number of DCR pool switches.
